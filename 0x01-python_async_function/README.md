# 0x01. Python - Async

## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is a form of parallel programming that allows a unit of work to run separately from the main application thread. Once that work is complete, it notifies the main thread about the completion or failure of the work.

In Python, asynchronous programming is primarily done using the `asyncio` library. This project tackles the basics of asynchronous programming, including using `async` and `await`, running concurrent coroutines, creating tasks, and using the random module.
