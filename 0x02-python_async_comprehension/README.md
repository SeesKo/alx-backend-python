# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## What is Async Comprehension?

Async comprehensions are a combination of asynchronous generators and comprehensions (like list comprehensions or dictionary comprehensions). They allow for asynchronous operations within comprehensions, enabling you to handle asynchronous data streams efficiently.

### Basic Concepts

1. Asynchronous Generators: These are generators that can use `await` inside them. They are defined using `async def` and `yield` values using yield.
2. Async for: This allows you to iterate over asynchronous iterators.
3. Async Comprehensions: These allow you to write comprehensions (like list comprehensions) that can await asynchronous operations.

## Requirements

- Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7).
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x).
- All files must be executable.
