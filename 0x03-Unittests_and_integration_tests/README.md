# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## Description

Unit testing is the process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs. A unit test is supposed to test standard inputs and corner cases. A unit test should only test the logic defined inside the tested function. Most calls to additional functions should be mocked, especially if they make network or database calls.

- Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
